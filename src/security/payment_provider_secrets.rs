//! At-rest encryption for the payment-provider credentials (`payment_providers`).
//!
//! Threat model
//! ------------
//! `payment_providers.api_key_encrypted` holds the provider's own credential (a Stripe
//! `sk_live_…`, a PayPal `client_id:client_secret` pair) and `webhook_secret_encrypted` holds the
//! endpoint's signing secret (`whsec_…`). Both are CUSTOMER-SUPPLIED and money-bearing: a database
//! dump, a leaked backup or a read-only SQL grant must not hand them over. The signing secret is
//! the sharper of the two, because it is the only thing that decides whether an anonymous
//! `POST /api/v1/webhooks/stripe` may complete a checkout session and trigger credential delivery.
//!
//! Migration 000010_payment_provider named both columns after a promise ("Encrypted API
//! credentials (encrypted-at-rest via app-layer encryption)") that the write path never kept: the
//! canonical upsert bound the raw request value into both columns. This module is the one
//! choke point that keeps the promise. Same class this fleet already fixed one app over
//! (kanban t_6104de65, WorkflowSwift); this app's instance is carded separately.
//!
//! Format, master key and the fail-closed rule are `crate::security::provider_key_crypto`'s — the
//! SAME envelope (`enc:v1:` + base64 AES-256 via pgcrypto) the rest of this app already uses for
//! `provider_keys.api_key` and `integration_targets.api_key`. There is
//! deliberately no second scheme to keep honest.
//!
//! Two halves, both required
//! -------------------------
//! * **Seal / open** at the call sites: `seal_for_write` before every bind into either column,
//!   `open_for_use` after every read of them. A stored value WITHOUT the envelope is a legacy
//!   plaintext row and is passed through unchanged, so nothing breaks before the backfill runs.
//! * **The boot half** (`seal_legacy_payment_provider_secrets`, called from `main.rs`): arm the DB
//!   guard if it is missing, seal every legacy plaintext row in place, then VALIDATE the guard.
//!   This app's runner (`src/db.rs::run_migrations`) re-executes EVERY migration file on every
//!   boot, so the guard is re-armed each start; the boot half still matters because it is the only
//!   step that SEALS a plaintext row that arrived from a restored dump, and the only path that can
//!   re-arm a guard a manual drop removed.
