//! `probe_addr` — recipient addresses a fleet harness owns, which must never be handed to a real
//! mail relay (parity with FunnelSwift, kanban t_36b55ed2).
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS
//!
//! The fleet's probe suites mint throwaway accounts through the real signup route, and the signup
//! route mails the generated first password. Some of those probes still address the fleet's own
//! dev domains — `swiftsoftware.dev`, `swiftsoftware.net` — which are REAL, registrable domains.
//! Measured on the fleet's Mailgun domains (events API, 2026-10-09): a message to
//! `*@swiftsoftware.dev` is `accepted` and then `bounced` (552), while a message to a customer
//! address is `delivered`. So the send reaches no one, burns a delivery on the domain's sending
//! reputation, and — when the address happens to be routable — lands in the fleet's own mailbox.
//!
//! The policy (`/opt/swift/docs/fleet-probe-residue-policy-2026-09-28.md`) classes
//! `swiftsoftware.dev/.local` as FLEET-DEV — the harness class. This module is the OUTBOUND half:
//! a signup addressed into the harness class is created normally but its mail is never sent, so a
//! probe can never reach an inbox.
//!
//! WHAT IS *NOT* HERE, AND WHY
//!
//! The RFC 2606 / 6761 class (`example.com/.net/.org`, `*.invalid`, `*.test`, `*.local`,
//! `localhost`) is deliberately NOT suppressed. Those names cannot resolve to a mailbox, so a send
//! to them can only bounce — and that is exactly the address class the content-level harnesses use
//! on purpose, pointing the provider at a local SMTP sink and reading the credential message off
//! the wire. Suppressing that class would delete the only harness that can prove a send still works.

/// The fleet's own harness domains. Every one of them is fleet-controlled: a message addressed here
/// can only land in a fleet mailbox, never in a customer's.
