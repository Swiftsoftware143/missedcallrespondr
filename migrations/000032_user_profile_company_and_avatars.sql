-- 000032_user_profile_company_and_avatars.sql
--
-- The fleet account/profile surface (programme card t_2cb77960, this app's card t_9cd2c8f2).
-- FunnelSwift shipped it on 2026-10-08 (t_ff948669); this app already had a Profile screen that
-- carried only a Name field, so a customer could not record their company and had no picture.
--
-- Three additive objects:
--
--   * `users.username` — the optional handle the fleet profile contract accepts alongside `name`
--     and `company`. Nullable: every existing account has none and must keep working.
--   * `users.company`  — the optional company/organisation the profile screen edits and /auth/me
--     returns. Nullable for the same reason.
--   * `user_avatars`   — ONE row per user holding the uploaded picture's bytes and the content type
--     sniffed from those bytes at upload time.
--
-- WHY THE PICTURE LIVES IN THE DATABASE, NOT A SERVED WEBROOT: this container is IMAGE-BAKED
-- (`bin/deploy-missedcallrespondr.sh` rebuilds the image; `docker restart` re-runs the OLD binary
-- and there is NO bind mount for a webroot). A file written at run time would die on the next
-- restart and no host webroot can serve it. The fleet's FunnelSwift reached the same verdict for
-- the same reason and streamed the bytes back through a route; this file is that shape.
--
-- IDEMPOTENT ON PURPOSE: `src/db.rs::run_migrations` re-executes EVERY registered file on EVERY
-- boot, so every statement below is `IF NOT EXISTS` and the second pass is a no-op. The CHECK on
-- the content type is guarded by a catalog probe for the same reason (a bare ADD CONSTRAINT would
-- abort the boot on the second pass).
--
-- The `user_avatars` row is keyed by `users.id` with ON DELETE CASCADE, so retiring a probe user
-- retires its picture with it and no orphan bytea row can outlive its owner.

ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS username text;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS company text;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_avatars (
    user_id      uuid PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    bytes        bytea NOT NULL,
    content_type text  NOT NULL,
    updated_at   timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- The content type is only ever the sniffed value for one of four magics (see
-- `auth::handlers::sniff_image`), and an empty body is refused before the write. Pin the four
-- values at the store so a future writer that forgets to sniff FAILS CLOSED instead of storing a
-- row the GET would serve under a guessed type.
